## Inspiration
This project is based on the goal of improving my skills as a Software Engineer and the best way to improve is by building projects. I wanted to gain a deeper understanding of Django and Object-oriented programming in Python whiles I also contribute to the open-source community at the same time. I have learnt different technologies for the project and I keep on learning new skills as I add new features to the project.
